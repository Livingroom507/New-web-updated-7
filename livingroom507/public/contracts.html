        <h3>Key Remote Closing Contracts</h3>
        <p>You will primarily be engaging with clients or partners via two core agreements:</p>
        
        <h4>1. Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Defines your relationship as a 1099 independent contractor, not an employee, which is typical for remote closing roles.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Terms:</strong> Clearly outlines <strong>compensation structure</strong> (commission-only, retainer + commission), payment schedules, and the specific services you will provide.</li>
            <li><strong>Termination Clause:</strong> Must clearly define the conditions under which either party can end the agreement, including required notice periods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Protects your client's proprietary information, such as their CRM data, client lists, offer details, and scripts.</li>
            <li><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> A reciprocal NDA also protects the unique closing methodologies and SOPs you bring to the partnership.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3>The Compensation Structure</h3>
        <p>Ensure your contracts clearly define the following to prevent future disputes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Commission Rate:</strong> State the exact percentage or fixed amount per successful close.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Trigger:</strong> Clearly state <em>when</em> the commission is earned (e.g., upon client signing, upon full payment, or upon the end of a refund period). <strong>Never assume.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Chargebacks & Refunds:</strong> Stipulate how commission is handled if a client requests a refund or initiates a chargeback after you have been paid.</li>
        </ul>
