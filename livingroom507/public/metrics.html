        <p>Effective remote closing is based on data, not intuition. Here is a reminder of the primary scaling metrics and how to actively optimize them:</p>

            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>KPI</th>
                    <th>Definition & Importance</th>
                    <th>Optimization Focus</th>
                </tr>

                    <td><strong>Closing Ratio</strong></td>
                    <td>Measures sales process efficiency (Calls → Clients). <strong>The most direct measure of your skill.</strong></td>
                    <td>Focus on <strong>Qualification-First</strong> method (Module 2) to ensure you only speak to highly viable leads.</td>
                </tr>

                    <td><strong>Revenue Per Sales Hour</strong></td>
                    <td>Tracks the dollar amount generated for every hour spent actively closing.</td>
                    <td>Minimize administrative tasks via <strong>SOPs and Delegation</strong> (Module 3). Higher efficiency = higher RPH.</td>

                    <td><strong>LTV:CAC Ratio</strong></td>
                    <td>The ratio of a client's Lifetime Value to their Acquisition Cost. <strong>A healthy ratio is 3:1 or higher.</strong></td>
                    <td>Increase LTV through quality service and referrals; reduce CAC by improving lead quality from your <strong>Affiliate Program</strong> (Module 3).</td>
