    <div class="card">
        <p>Your success as an Empath Closer is valuable. We actively cultivate relationships with high-growth businesses and entrepreneurs who specifically seek closers trained in integrity and high-ticket systems. This section outlines your pathway from certification to placement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3>The Certification Advantage</h3>
        <p>Completing all three modules and passing the assessments certifies you as an <strong>Empath Closer</strong>. This designation validates your skills in psychology, system application, and ethical scaling—qualities our hiring partners prioritize above all else.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3>The Placement Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Profile Creation:</strong> Complete the final certification form to generate your placement profile, which includes your assessment scores and a summary of your closing philosophy.</li>
            <li><strong>Vetting & Matching:</strong> Our team matches your profile with roles from our network of high-ticket coaches, service providers, and agencies who require remote closing talent.</li>
            <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> We facilitate a warm introduction to the hiring partner. You will enter the interview process having already been pre-vetted based on your training results.</li>
            <li><strong>Ongoing Support:</strong> We provide interview preparation materials focused on translating your 'Empath Closer' methodology into a language hiring managers understand (e.g., 'high Closing Ratio,' 'low CAC,' 'high LTV').</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Current Partner Focus Areas</h3>
        <p>Our partners typically operate in sectors where integrity and high-trust selling are paramount:</p>
        <div class="partner-box">
            <h4>High-Ticket Coaching & Consulting</h4>
            <p>Partners who sell programs priced $5,000+ and require closers who prioritize client diagnosis over quick conversion. Ideal for closers with a strong background in <strong>The Diagnostic Approach</strong> (Module 1).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="partner-box">
            <h4>Digital Agencies & SaaS</h4>
            <p>Companies selling long-term contracts (>$10,000 LTV) where pipeline management and systematic follow-up are essential. Expertise in <strong>High-Ticket CRM Setup</strong> (Module 2) is a key requirement here.</p>
